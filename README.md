# Designing-a-1-8-Analog-De-multiplexer

In this collaborative project, a team of four individuals undertook the design and implementation of a 1:8 Analog De-multiplexer using MOSFETs within the Cadence 
environment. The objective of this endeavour was to develop a high-performance analog circuit capable of accurately and efficiently demultiplexing an input signal into eight distinct output channels. To achieve this, the team employed the MOSFETs, leveraging their exceptional characteristics to construct transmission gates for signal routing and manipulation.
